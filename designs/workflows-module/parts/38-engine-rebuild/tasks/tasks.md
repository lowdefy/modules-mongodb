# Implementation Tasks — Part 38: Engine rebuild (FSM + load-plan-commit)

## Overview

These tasks implement Part 38, which rebuilds the workflow engine around two combined axes: a per-kind FSM signal model (replacing the priority-rule + `force: true` transition model) and a load → pre-hook → plan → commit → post-hook architecture (replacing the mutable-`context` interleaved handler flow). Part 38 also absorbs Part 34's access model (per-verb `access` map, `visible_verbs`, signal→verb submit gating, per-verb `links` map, emitted-id naming) and salvages Part 30's on-disk action-doc display contract. Derived from `designs/workflows-module/parts/38-engine-rebuild/design.md`.

## Implementation Bands

The 23 tasks group into five dependency bands. **A band is the unit of work** — point an agent at this file and a band number ("implement Band 3 of `38-engine-rebuild`"); it implements every task in the band, in the listed internal order, then runs the band's gate before stopping.

**Rules for an agent working a band:**

- Implement tasks in the **internal order** shown. Where tasks are marked **parallel-safe**, they touch disjoint files and may be done in any order (or concurrently) — but a single agent should still do them one at a time and commit between them.
- Do **not** start a band until its **Depends on bands** are committed and green. The cross-task dependencies inside `## Tasks` are the source of truth for finer-grained ordering.
- Each task's own file is authoritative for scope, file list, and acceptance criteria. This section only sequences them.
- **Gate** = run the new + existing unit tests for the touched files and ensure they pass before considering the band done. Commit per task.

### Band 1 — Foundations ✅ Done

- **Tasks:** 1, 2, 4 (parallel-safe) → 3 (after 4)
- **Depends on bands:** none
- **Notes:** Driver layer (1), FSM tables (2), and connection-schema wiring (4) share no state. Render layer (3) consumes the `entry_id` mechanic from (4) for link computation, so it follows 4.
- **Gate:** unit tests for the mongo helpers, FSM tables, and render walker pass.

### Band 2 — Access-model cluster ✅ Done

- **Tasks:** 5 → 6, 7, 8 (6/7/8 parallel-safe after 5)
- **Depends on bands:** none (runs concurrently with Band 1)
- **Notes:** Part 34's absorption. The role-gate oracle fixtures (5) are the single `(gate, roles)→bool` source of truth across the three runtimes that can't share code; the three engine-independent surfaces (6 `validateActionAccess`, 7 `visible_verbs_filter.yaml`, 8 `action_role_check`) all sit on it and are sequenced **alongside, not interleaved with**, the rebuild core (per design D16) so they don't gate on it.
- **Gate:** fixture table + validator/filter/client-check tests pass.

### Band 3 — Phases (load · plan · commit) — in progress

- **Tasks:** 9 ✅ → 10 ✅, 11 ✅, 21 ✅ → 12 ✅ → 13 ✅, 22 → 14
- **Depends on bands:** 1, 2
- **Progress:** Tasks 9, 10, 11, 21, 12, 13 done. Remaining: 22 (callApi-contract catch-up on landed code — do before 14, whose hook wrappers build on the corrected contract), then 14 (last in band).
- **Task 21 ran first** — it was the reviews-8–13 deviation catch-up on already-implemented tasks (4, 6, 10), making the required `entity_ref_key` real (validated, in the resolver's pick whitelist, present in demo configs) before task 12's `planEventDispatch` was written against it.
- **Q6 (form_data merge rule) — RESOLVED:** uniform deep-merge (objects deep-merge; arrays/scalars/`null` replace whole) onto the loaded `form_data.{action}` sub-object. The resolved rule is baked into task 11; no decision remains before implementing `planFormDataMerge`.
- **Notes:** Phase types + load phase (9) anchor the contracts. Planners (10–12) are pure functions over FSM/render. Commit (13) and hook wrappers (14) close the cycle. The write-path-coupled Part 34 pieces — the submit-time access gate (in load, 9) and per-verb `computeEngineLinks` (in render, 3) — live here because they share the rebuild's surface.
- **Gate:** planner unit tests pass; commit phase tested on both transaction and standalone paths incl. the CAS-miss gate.

### Band 4 — Handler rewrites

- **Tasks:** 15 → 16; 23 → 17 (the 23→17 chain is parallel-safe with 15/16)
- **Depends on bands:** 3
- **Notes:** Submit (15) is the reference handler. The tracker cascade (16) reuses 100% of the Submit planner machinery and so follows it. The planner-contract catch-up (23, from review-13) extends the landed Band 3 planners (`seedStage`, `lifecyclePush`), flips the tracker `none` row, and reconciles the cascade `fire.payload` passthrough if 16 landed without it — it must precede Start/Cancel/Close (17), which consume all four. 17 composes the same phases independently and can run parallel to 15/16.
- **Gate:** handler-level tests pass; obsolete files deleted per task 15.

### Band 5 — Surfaces

- **Tasks:** 18, 19 (parallel-safe)
- **Depends on bands:** 4 (and 1–3 transitively)
- **Notes:** Display renames (18) + payload mapping (19). The demo capstone formerly here (task 20) is superseded by [Part 45](../../45-demo-rebuild/design.md)'s from-scratch demo rebuild — task 20 is now a stub pointing there.
- **Gate:** module builds with the renamed pages; emitted payloads carry `signal` (no `force`). The end-to-end exercise of the rebuilt engine is Part 45's demo rebuild + happy-path e2e (after Parts 43 and 44).

**Cross-band parallelism:** Bands 1 and 2 are independent and can run concurrently. All other bands are sequential on the band(s) listed.

**Open questions:** Q1–Q6 are all resolved in the design and baked into the relevant tasks as decisions. Q6 (form_data merge rule) resolved to a uniform deep-merge (objects deep-merge; arrays/scalars/`null` replace whole) onto the loaded `form_data.{action}` sub-object — its analysis and edge cases are embedded in task 11.

## Scope

**Source:** `designs/workflows-module/parts/38-engine-rebuild/design.md`
**Context files considered:** none — `design.md` is the only non-review file in the design folder. (Prerequisite concept/part designs referenced but not re-tasked here: `workflows-module-concept/state-machine/design.md`, Part 34 `_completed/34-action-access-model`, Part 35 `_completed/35-rename-task-kind-to-simple`, Part 30 `_rejected/30-status-map-rendering`.)
**Review files skipped:** `review/review-1.md` – `review/review-11.md`, `review/consistency-4.md`, `review/consistency-5.md`, `review/consistency-8.md`, `review/consistency-14.md` — all their decisions are already folded into `design.md` and these task files (reviews 4–11 were actioned directly into the tasks after the initial tasking pass). **Reviews 12 and 13 are actioned** (review-13's landed-code contract changes live in task 23). **Reviews 14–15 are written but not yet actioned**: review-15 (task 22 — InternalApi hook emission, stale docstrings, resolved-wiring verification) before implementing task 22; review-14 (task 18 vs Parts 40/42/43 — rename double-work) before implementing Band 5.
