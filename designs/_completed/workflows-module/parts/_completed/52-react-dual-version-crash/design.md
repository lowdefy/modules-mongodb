# Part 52 — ActionSteps render crash: React 18/19 duplication in the build (handover brief)

The `ActionSteps` block throws **React error #31** the moment it renders, blanking the entity action surface (`actions-on-entity`) and the workflow/group overview pages, and failing the Part 22 e2e suite's `check-blocked-by` spec. The data feeding the block is correct — the crash is purely client-side render. The verified root cause is **two React majors (18.2.0 and 19.2.6) coexisting in the built client bundle**: latest Lowdefy is uniformly React 18.2.0 (every server + the client pin `18.2.0`, antd `6.3.1`), but this repo's `modules-mongodb-plugins` package declares only floating peer ranges (`react >=18`, `antd >=6`), so pnpm resolves them _up_ to React 19.2.6 / antd 6.4.3 — pulling the antd v6 ecosystem and the `@lowdefy` blocks the plugin depends on onto React 19, while the generated server stays on React 18. Elements created under one major carry a `$$typeof` symbol the other major's renderer rejects → #31. `ActionSteps` is the surface that crosses the boundary (a `modules-mongodb-plugins` block that imports `antd` directly and feeds React children into antd's `Steps`). This is a **dependency-resolution problem, not a block-code bug** — `ActionSteps` is authored correctly (peer-dep React/antd, swc transpile, no bundled React). The fix is to pin the plugin's React/antd dev versions to match what latest Lowdefy ships (18.2.0 / 6.3.1); no pnpm overrides or vite dedupe needed.

**Layer:** the `modules-mongodb-plugins` package's dependency declarations. **Size:** S — pin the plugin's React/antd to the versions latest Lowdefy actually ships. **Repo:** `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/package.json` (in this repo, no upstream coordination required). Surfaces in `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/src/blocks/ActionSteps/`.

## Symptom & reproduction

- **Spec:** `apps/workflows-test/e2e/workflows/check-blocked-by.spec.js` — `getByText('Waiting on the first prep check.')` times out; the entity surface renders the workflow header but the `action_steps` subtree is gone.
- **Browser console (captured via a probe against the running e2e server):**
  ```
  [BlockError] Minified React error #31 ... at entity_workflows.0.action_steps.
    Caused by: object with keys {$$typeof, type, key, ref, props}
  ```
  React #31 = "Objects are not valid as a React child." The reported object **is** a React element; React refuses it because its `$$typeof` came from a different React instance. Lowdefy's block error boundary catches the throw and renders nothing for that block — hence the blank area (the rest of the page survives).
- **Affected blocks:** `ActionSteps` confirmed. **`EventsTimeline`** is the same shape (a `modules-mongodb-plugins` block importing `antd` and building element trees) — treat as affected until proven otherwise; it is the timeline on the same surfaces.
- **Not affected:** form pages built from `@lowdefy/blocks-antd` blocks (TextInput/Button/Card) render fine — the host's own block package and react-dom sit on the same React copy; only the `modules-mongodb-plugins` blocks land on the other one.

## Root cause (verified)

1. **Two React majors are installed.** pnpm store contains both `react@18.2.0` + `react-dom@18.2.0` and `react@19.2.6` + `react-dom@19.2.6`.
2. **Both are bundled into the client.** The built client bundle (`apps/workflows-test/.lowdefy/server/dist/client/assets/main-*.js`) contains **both** element symbols: `Symbol.for("react.element")` (React 18) ×7 and `Symbol.for("react.transitional.element")` (React 19) ×5. React 19 renamed the element symbol, so an element minted by one major fails the other major's `isValidElement` → #31 with exactly the observed `{$$typeof, type, key, ref, props}` (React-18-shaped, with a separate `ref` key) signature.
3. **Latest Lowdefy is uniformly React 18.2.0 — the React 19 is introduced _only_ by this repo's plugin package.** Every Lowdefy package that pins React pins `18.2.0` and antd `6.3.1` (verified in the `lowdefy` repo: `packages/servers/server`, `server-dev`, `server-e2e`, `packages/client` all declare `react`/`react-dom` `18.2.0`, `antd 6.3.1`; the block packages — `blocks-antd`, `blocks-basic`, `plugin-aws` — declare `react >=18` as **peers** and resolve to `18.2.0` inside that monorepo, which has no React 19 anywhere). The duplication in _this_ repo is self-inflicted: `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/package.json` declares only **floating** peer ranges (`react >=18`, `react-dom >=18`, `antd >=6`, `@lowdefy/plugin-aws >=4.0.0`), and because the plugin has no concrete dev pin, pnpm resolves those ranges _up_ to the newest published versions — `react@19.2.6`, `react-dom@19.2.6`, `antd@6.4.3`, `plugin-aws@5.3.0` (lockfile importer block for `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins`). The generated `.lowdefy` server stays on `18.2.0`/`6.3.1`. So the antd v6 ecosystem (`@ant-design/*`, `@rc-component/*`), `@lowdefy/block-utils`, `blocks-basic`, `blocks-antd`, and `plugin-aws` resolve against `react@19.2.6` **only because the plugin importer pulled React 19** — not because anything upstream targets it. (This also explains the sprawl: antd `6.3.1` from the server vs `6.4.3` from the plugin's `>=6`.)
4. **`ActionSteps` is correct.** `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/package.json` declares `react >=18`, `antd >=6` as **peer** deps and builds with `swc` per-file transpile (no bundling) — it relies on the host to provide one React/antd. The peer _ranges_ are right; what's missing is a concrete build pin telling pnpm which versions to resolve them against locally. The fault is install/resolution, not the block.

## The fix — match the plugin's React/antd to the versions latest Lowdefy ships

The block code needs no change, and **no pnpm `overrides` are required.** The duplication exists only because the plugin's floating peer ranges resolve _up_ to React 19 while the Lowdefy server stays on React 18.2.0. The lever is to pin the plugin's local build/resolution to the _actual_ versions latest Lowdefy uses, so the whole tree converges on one React naturally.

### D1 — Pin the plugin's React/antd to latest Lowdefy's actual versions

Latest Lowdefy ships **`react`/`react-dom` `18.2.0`** and **`antd` `6.3.1`** (verified in the `lowdefy` repo, see Root cause #3 — it is uniformly React 18, no React 19 anywhere). Match those exact versions in `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/package.json` by adding them as **devDependencies**, while keeping the **peerDependencies as the existing ranges** (`react >=18`, `react-dom >=18`, `antd >=6`) for consumer flexibility:

```jsonc
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": ">=18",        // unchanged — consumers may run 18 or 19
  "react-dom": ">=18",
  "antd": ">=6"
  // … other @lowdefy peers unchanged …
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@swc/cli": "0.6.0",
  "@swc/core": "1.11.24",
  "react": "18.2.0",      // pin local build/resolution to what latest Lowdefy ships
  "react-dom": "18.2.0",
  "antd": "6.3.1"
}
```

Because the plugin is a workspace package, pnpm satisfies its peer dependencies from its **own** dependencies/devDependencies when present. Declaring `react`/`react-dom` `18.2.0` and `antd` `6.3.1` as devDeps therefore forces the plugin importer to resolve against React 18.2.0 / antd 6.3.1 instead of floating up to 19.2.6 / 6.4.3. Everything the plugin pulls transitively — `@lowdefy/block-utils`, `blocks-basic`, `blocks-antd`, `@lowdefy/plugin-aws`, the antd/`@rc-component` ecosystem — then resolves against React 18.2.0 too, collapsing the store to a single React copy. No override needed; we are simply matching the actual published versions.

This mirrors exactly how Lowdefy develops its own block packages: peer ranges for consumers, a concrete pinned build environment (`18.2.0`) for the package itself. It is the "one correct way" — the version constraint lives on the package that introduced the drift, not in a top-level override that future contributors must remember.

### D2 — Why React 18, not 19

Match what latest Lowdefy actually runs, which is **React 18.2.0**. The earlier instinct to align "forward" on React 19 was based on the mistaken read that the ecosystem had moved to 19 — it hasn't: every Lowdefy server and the client pin `18.2.0`, and antd v6 supports both majors. React 19 appeared here purely as an artifact of unpinned `>=` ranges resolving to the newest publish. Pinning the plugin to 18.2.0 makes the plugin and the host renderer share one copy. (If latest Lowdefy later moves its servers to React 19, bump these dev pins to match — the rule is "match what the host ships," not a fixed number.)

### D3 — No overrides, no vite dedupe needed in this repo

The previous plan reached for a root `pnpm.overrides` pin and an upstream `resolve.dedupe` in the generated `vite.config.js`. Neither is needed: once the plugin resolves against the same versions as the server, only one React is installed, so there is nothing to dedupe or override away. An override would mask the real cause (the plugin's unpinned ranges) and force every future contributor to maintain a top-level pin; matching the actual versions on the offending package fixes it at the source. (A `resolve.dedupe` in the Lowdefy server template would still be a reasonable upstream belt-and-braces, but it is **not part of this fix** and requires no coordination here.)

### D4 — Do not "fix" it inside ActionSteps

Tempting workarounds — having `ActionSteps` import React/antd from the host via some shim, or stop importing `antd` directly — are rejected. The block is authored to the correct contract (peer deps, no bundled React); the duplication is environmental. Patching the block would mask a build defect that still bites every other `modules-mongodb-plugins` block (`EventsTimeline`, future blocks) and every consuming app. Fix the environment once.

## Verification

1. After editing the plugin's `package.json`, reinstall: `pnpm install`. Confirm the store now holds a **single** React: `ls node_modules/.pnpm | grep -E '^react(-dom)?@'` should show only `react@18.2.0` / `react-dom@18.2.0...` (no `react@19.*`). Likewise the lockfile's `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins` importer block should resolve `react`/`react-dom` to `18.2.0` and `antd` to `6.3.1`.
2. Rebuild: `cd apps/workflows-test && rm -rf .lowdefy && pnpm e2e e2e/workflows/check-blocked-by.spec.js`.
3. Confirm the client bundle contains **one** element symbol: grep `…/.lowdefy/server/dist/client/assets/main-*.js` for `react.element` / `react.transitional.element` — only `react.element` (React 18) should appear.
4. The `check-blocked-by` spec should pass (blocked messages render); re-run the full `e2e/workflows` suite. (Note the suite is also gated by the `extractBlockMap` `slots` fix in `@lowdefy/e2e-utils` and the engine `user.roles` change — see Related.)
5. Sanity-check `EventsTimeline` renders on a surface that uses it (e.g. `lead-view`).

## Open item to confirm (diagnostic colour, does not change the fix)

Which copy each side resolves to — i.e. _why_ `@lowdefy/blocks-antd` form blocks render but `modules-mongodb-plugins` blocks crash — is unconfirmed (most likely the host react-dom + its block package share one major while `modules-mongodb-plugins` resolves the other). The fix (converge on one React) is correct regardless; this only matters if convergence somehow doesn't resolve it.

## Files changed (expected)

- **`plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/package.json`** — add `react`/`react-dom` `18.2.0` and `antd` `6.3.1` as **devDependencies** to pin the plugin's build/resolution to latest Lowdefy's actual versions; leave peerDependencies as the existing ranges (D1/D2). Then `pnpm install` to update the lockfile.
- **No root `package.json` override and no vite `resolve.dedupe`** — explicitly _not_ needed (D3).
- **No change to** `plugins/modules-mongodb-plugins/src/blocks/ActionSteps/` (D4) — the block is correct.

## Non-goals

- **Rewriting `ActionSteps`/`EventsTimeline`** (D4).
- **The `actions-on-entity` layout polish** — F17 in [Part 51](../_next/51-ui-fix-sweep-NOTES.md) (title + steps wrapping) is a _separate_, non-fatal flex bug on the same component; fix independently. This part is only the fatal React crash.
- **Resolving the antd `6.3.1` vs `6.4.3` / multi-version `@lowdefy` sprawl** beyond what the React pin requires — broader dep hygiene, separate effort.

- [Part 22 — Workflows e2e suite](designs/workflows-module/parts/_completed/22-workflows-e2e-suite/design.md) — the suite this crash fails; two sibling blockers found alongside it and handled separately: (a) `@lowdefy/e2e-utils` `extractBlockMap` doesn't traverse the new `slots` build shape (upstream helper fix, in flight); (b) the engine reading roles from `user.apps[app_name].roles` instead of `user.roles` (engine fix by the user; test fixtures already scrubbed to top-level `roles`).
- [Part 51 — UI/bug fix sweep](../51-ui-fix-sweep-NOTES.md) — F17 (`actions-on-entity` layout) touches the same component but is non-fatal.
