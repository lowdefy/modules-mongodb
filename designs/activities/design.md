# Activities Module

## Problem

The monorepo models CRM entities (`companies`, `contacts`) and immutable audit (`events`) but has no place for **editable, user-owned records of work done with or for those entities** — calls made, meetings held, emails sent, notes taken, tasks to do.

Apps building on these modules need:

1. A standalone entity that users create, edit, and complete over time (unlike `events`, which is append-only).
2. Multi-entity linking — one activity often touches several contacts and a company, later a deal.
3. A per-entity activity feed surfaced inside contact/company detail pages, independent of the system-events timeline.
4. A foundation that later accepts automatically-captured activities from calendar events, forwarded/cc'd emails, and WhatsApp/voicenote channels — without re-shaping the data model.

This design introduces an `activities` module that sits alongside `events`, follows the `companies`/`contacts` entity-module pattern, and reserves the schema surface needed for future ingestion channels.

See [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) for the log of resolved open
questions and why each choice was made.

## Key decisions

**Standalone entity module, not an extension of `events`.** Activities are user-editable and have a lifecycle; events are append-only audit. Keeping them in one collection would force every edit to either mutate audit history (wrong) or spawn a new event per save (cluttered). Two collections, each with a clear role.

**Typed linking arrays (`contact_ids`, `company_ids`, later `deal_ids`) on the activity doc, no reverse denormalization.** The link fields themselves mirror the `references` shape already used by `events`. Unlike the existing contact ↔ company relationship — where `update-company` maintains `global_attributes.company_ids` on contacts via `$pull`/`$addToSet` — activities are **not** denormalized onto contacts/companies. Reverse lookups (activities-for-this-contact) are served by indexes on `contact_ids` / `company_ids`, not by a denormalized `activity_ids` list on parent docs. This is a deliberate departure from the company-contact pattern: activities will grow far faster than either parent entity, and keeping a reverse list in sync across future automated ingestion channels (calendar, email, WhatsApp) would make every ingestion path a multi-collection write with more failure modes than benefits.

**Status modelled as a newest-first array of `{stage, created}` entries**, following the repo's status-array convention. Current stage = `status[0].stage`. Completion timestamp = `status.find(s => s.stage === 'done').created.timestamp`. One schema, full history, no separate `completed_at`/`cancelled_at` fields needed.

**Uniform status lifecycle across all types.** Every activity has a status stage: `open`, `done`, or `cancelled`. A note is created with `done`; a task is created with `open`. The initial stage is driven by a `default_stage` in the activity-type enum so the form can default sensibly per type.

**Extensible `activity_types` enum, same shape as `event_types`.** Core types shipped: `call`, `meeting`, `email`, `note`, `task`. Consuming apps add their own via the `activity_types` module var, merged with built-ins.

**Events still get emitted for lifecycle transitions.** `create-activity`, `update-activity`, `complete-activity`, `cancel-activity`, `reopen-activity`, `delete-activity` — each with `references` carrying the linked contact/company IDs so the system-events timeline on those entities reflects activity churn. The activity's own detail page shows its own system-events timeline.

**Separate `tile_activities` and `tile_events` on parent-entity detail pages.** Users see _what was done_ (activities) distinct from _what happened in the system_ (events). `tile_activities` is added as a new, parallel component titled "Activity". The existing `tile_events` on company/contact pages is retitled from "Activity" → "History" to resolve the name collision and align the UI labels with the user's mental model (activities = things users did; history = system audit log).

**Reserved `source` field for future auto-ingestion channels.** `source: { channel, external_ref, raw }` where `channel ∈ {manual, calendar, email-forward, whatsapp, voicenote}` and `external_ref` is the upstream ID (calendar event id, email message-id, WhatsApp message id). `raw` holds the original payload. Channel ingestion endpoints land in a later phase; the field is carved out now so the v1 schema is forward-compatible.

## Data model

Collection: `activities` (configurable via `collection` var, default `activities`).

```yaml
_id: UUID # generated client-side
type: call | meeting | email | note | task # extensible string — keyed into activity_types enum
title: string # short subject line
description: string # longer body — rich-text HTML, edited and rendered via the Tiptap block (Lowdefy v5)
status: # newest-first array
  - stage: open | done | cancelled
    created:
      timestamp: ISODate
      user: { name, id }
contact_ids: [UUID, ...] # linked contacts
company_ids: [UUID, ...] # linked companies
# deal_ids: [UUID, ...]                # reserved for later — not created in v1
attributes: object # consumer-defined extra fields (same pattern as companies.attributes)
# Attachments are stored in the `files` module's own collection, keyed by
# a reference to this activity — not inlined here. See "Attachments" below.
source:
  channel: manual | calendar | email-forward | whatsapp | voicenote
  external_ref: string | null
  raw: object | null
created: change_stamp
updated: change_stamp
removed: null | change_stamp # null on insert (matches create-company); set to change_stamp by `delete-activity`
```

### Indexes

- `{ contact_ids: 1 }` — activities-for-contact lookup
- `{ company_ids: 1 }` — activities-for-company lookup
- `{ 'status.0.stage': 1, 'updated.timestamp': -1 }` — list filters + sort. **Fixed-position, not multikey** — we only ever query current stage; a multikey index on `status.stage` would incorrectly match "has ever been in stage X".
- `{ type: 1 }` — type filter on list page
- `{ 'source.channel': 1, 'source.external_ref': 1 }` with `partialFilterExpression: { 'source.external_ref': { $exists: true } }` — dedupe for ingestion channels. (Not `sparse`: on a compound index, `sparse` only skips docs missing _all_ indexed fields, and `source.channel` is always set — so `sparse` would index every doc. A partial index on `external_ref` existence is the correct shape.)

### Derived values (pipeline)

On reads, a shared pipeline stage projects derived fields:

```yaml
$addFields:
  current_stage: { $arrayElemAt: ["$status.stage", 0] }
  completed_at:
    $let:
      vars:
        done:
          $arrayElemAt:
            - $filter:
                input: "$status"
                cond: { $eq: ["$$this.stage", "done"] }
            - 0
      in: "$$done.created.timestamp"
  cancelled_at: # same shape as completed_at, cond: { $eq: ["$$this.stage", "cancelled"] }
  opened_at:    # same shape, cond: { $eq: ["$$this.stage", "open"] } — most recent open, handles reopens
```

Lives in `modules/activities/requests/stages/add_derived_fields.yaml` so list, selector, and detail all share one source of truth.

### IDs

Activities use plain UUIDs (`_id` generated client-side). No human-readable
consecutive ID (`A-0001`-style) is issued. Activities are high-volume, are
rarely referenced by humans individually, and will be created from automated
channels where monotonic ID coordination is more trouble than it's worth.

### Attachments

Files attached to an activity live in the `files` module's collection,
keyed by `(entity_type: 'activity', entity_id: <activity uuid>)` — the
same indexing surface every other entity module uses. Nothing is
inlined on the activity doc; S3 lifecycle stays in the files module.

The activities module ships a local
`modules/activities/components/tile_files.yaml` wrapper, mirroring
`modules/companies/components/tile_files.yaml` — refs `files.file-card`
with `entity_type: activity` and `entity_id: { _url_query: _id }`. The
detail page's sidebar embeds this local tile (not a cross-module one;
the files module exports `file-card` / `file-manager` / `file-list`,
not a `tile_files`).

> **Future cleanup — `tile_files` consolidation.** Every entity module
> ships a near-identical 7-line `tile_files.yaml` wrapping
> `files.file-card`. The wrapping mostly renames + hardcodes
> `entity_type`. Worth a separate cross-cutting PR (companies, contacts,
> activities, files) to either drop the local wrappers in favour of
> consumers using `files.file-card` inline, or push a parameterised
> `tile_files` into the files module as the canonical export. Out of
> scope here — activities follows the existing convention.

### Default sort

Lists and tiles sort by `updated.timestamp` desc by default. If a scheduled
time is introduced later (see "Deferred" below), the list can expose a
secondary sort or preset for pending items by schedule.

## Module surface

Follows the `companies`/`contacts` entity-module layout.

### Dependencies

- `layout` — page layout wrapper (required)
- `events` — emits lifecycle events + pulls `change_stamp` component (required)
- `contacts` — contact selector, linking (required)
- `companies` — company selector, linking (required)
- `files` — file attachments (optional, same treatment as in `companies`)

`contacts` and `companies` are deliberately required rather than
optional. The module's whole value proposition is _CRM activities
linked to contacts and companies_ — a consumer without either entity
isn't the target; the right answer for project-management-flavoured
use cases is a separate `tasks` module that reuses the status-array
pattern but not the CRM linking. Making these deps optional would
layer conditional field, selector, and detail-page wiring across the
module for a consumer who doesn't exist yet. `files`, by contrast, is
genuinely auxiliary — activities are still useful without
attachments, so that dep is optional.

## Activity types enum (built-in)

`modules/activities/enums/activity_types.yaml`:

```yaml
call:
  title: Call
  color: "#1890ff"
  icon: AiOutlinePhone
  default_stage: done # typically logged after the fact
meeting:
  title: Meeting
  color: "#722ed1"
  icon: AiOutlineCalendar
  default_stage: done # v1: meetings are logged after the fact (like calls/emails). Flip to 'open' once scheduled_at lands.
email:
  title: Email
  color: "#13c2c2"
  icon: AiOutlineMail
  default_stage: done # logged after sending
note:
  title: Note
  color: "#8c8c8c"
  icon: AiOutlineFileText
  default_stage: done # instant
task:
  title: Task
  color: "#fa8c16"
  icon: AiOutlineCheckSquare
  default_stage: open # awaiting completion
```

Merging pattern copied from `events.event_types`:

```yaml
# module.lowdefy.yaml
components:
  - id: activity_types
    component:
      _build.object.assign:
        - _ref: enums/activity_types.yaml
        - _module.var: activity_types
```

Consumers extend via the `activity_types` var.

## Events emitted

`modules/activities/enums/event_types.yaml`:

| Event type          | When                                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-activity`   | New activity inserted                                                             |
| `update-activity`   | Activity's editable fields edited (title, description, contact_ids, company_ids, attributes) |
| `complete-activity` | Status transitions to `done`                                                      |
| `cancel-activity`   | Status transitions to `cancelled`                                                 |
| `reopen-activity`   | Status transitions to `open` after being `done` or `cancelled`                    |
| `delete-activity`   | Activity soft-deleted                                                             |

Every emitted event carries `references: { contact_ids, company_ids, activity_ids: [self] }` so:

- The activity's own detail page shows its system-events timeline (via `activity_ids` reference on the events-timeline component, same pattern as company/contact detail pages).
- Each linked contact's and company's existing `tile_events` reflects activity lifecycle alongside other system events.

The `event_display` default provides Nunjucks titles like `{{ user.profile.name }} logged a {{ target.type_label }} with {{ target.title }}`.

## Linking: how parent entities surface activities

### Forward: list of activities on company / contact detail

New component `tile_activities` added to the `activities` module, consumed by `companies` and `contacts` (and later `deals`) in their existing sidebar-tile slots.

```yaml
# inside company-detail.yaml, sidebar_slots area (or via components.sidebar_slots var)
- _ref:
    module: activities
    component: tile_activities
    vars:
      reference_field: company_ids
      reference_value:
        _url_query: _id # matches how tile_events resolves the detail-page entity
```

The tile:

- Pulls recent activities via `get_activities_for_entity` request, parameterised by `reference_field` + `reference_value`.
- Shows a compact list ordered by `updated.timestamp` desc, with type icon, title, current-stage badge, and relative time.
- Embeds `capture_activity` in its header, prefilled with the current entity linked (see "Capture entry points" below). The tile **auto-wires its own list refetch** as the embedded `capture_activity`'s `on_created`, so a freshly captured activity appears immediately without a page refresh. Consumers placing `capture_activity` elsewhere (their own panel with its own list) follow the same pattern explicitly.
- "View all" link navigates to the activities list page with a
  pre-applied filter, mirroring `tile_contacts.yaml`'s pattern. URL
  param name varies by `reference_field`: `?contact_id=<uuid>` when
  `reference_field: contact_ids`, `?company_id=<uuid>` when
  `reference_field: company_ids`. Singular keys, matching how
  `tile_contacts` already passes `company_id` into the contacts list.

  ```yaml
  events:
    onClick:
      - id: go_activities
        type: Link
        params:
          pageId: { _module.pageId: { id: all, module: activities } }
          urlQuery:
            # one of these — driven by reference_field
            contact_id: { _url_query: _id }
            # company_id: { _url_query: _id }
  ```

  The activities list page (`pageId: all`) reads `_url_query: contact_id`
  and `_url_query: company_id` on `onInit` and pre-populates its filter
  state — see the list page section below.

### Backward: picking activities from elsewhere

`activity-selector` component exported the same way `company-selector` and `contact-selector` are exported — Multiple or single-select, with search and recent-first ordering. Not required for v1 (no module currently needs to link _to_ an activity), but included because the pattern is cheap once the selector pipeline stage exists and future modules (deals, tickets) will want it.

## Capture entry points

Users create activities from many places: contact/company detail tiles,
page headers, the home page, a keyboard shortcut, a deep-link in an email
or chat. Rather than each consumer reimplementing the "create activity"
flow, the module exports one reusable component plus URL-param support on
the new-activity page (`pageId: new`).

### `capture_activity` — primary export

A self-contained button-plus-modal bundle. Drop it anywhere on a page
and it provides a capture flow that stays in context (no navigation).

```yaml
- _ref:
    module: activities
    component: capture_activity
    vars:
      # Prefill — all optional
      prefill:
        type: call
        contact_ids:
          - _url_query: _id # host is contact-detail; matches how tile_events resolves context
        company_ids: []
        title: ""
        description: ""
      # Appearance
      label: Log activity
      icon: AiOutlinePlus
      button_type: primary # primary | default | link | text
      size: middle # small | middle | large
      # Behaviour
      mode: modal # modal (default) | page
      on_created: # optional action sequence to run after successful create
        - id: refetch_list
          type: Request
          params: get_activities_for_entity
```

Internals:

- The component is a Button + Modal pair. Clicking the button sets local
  state (`state.capture.open = true`, plus the prefill fields) and opens
  the modal.
- The modal renders `form_activity` (same form as the new-activity
  page) with prefill applied.
- Submit calls the `create-activity` API, closes the modal, clears state,
  runs the consumer-provided `on_created` action sequence if present.
- Multiple instances can coexist on a page (header + tile + row action);
  each carries its own state.

The `mode: page` variant skips the modal and links to `pageId: new`
with the prefill carried in `urlQuery`. Useful for main-nav buttons
where users expect a dedicated page, and for contexts where a modal
would feel wrong.

### `open_capture` action — custom triggers

Not every trigger is a button. An app menu item, a command palette entry,
a list row action, or a keyboard shortcut might all need to open the
capture flow. The `open_capture` action is exported as a **component**
(Lowdefy's cross-module sharing mechanism — there is no `action:` key on
`_ref`; any config fragment shared across modules is a component):

```yaml
events:
  onClick:
    _ref:
      module: activities
      component: open_capture
      vars:
        prefill:
          type: note
```

**Behaviour:** always links to `pageId: new` with the prefill carried
in `urlQuery` — equivalent to `capture_activity`'s `mode: page`. Never
opens a modal. Consumers wanting an in-context modal flow use
`capture_activity` directly.

Why not "open the modal if `capture_activity` is on the page, else
navigate"? Because multiple `capture_activity` instances can coexist on
a page (header + tile + row action, each with its own state), and a
shared `open_capture` trigger has no way to pick which modal to open.
Single-purpose exports — `capture_activity` = modal, `open_capture` =
navigate — keep the mental model clean.

The file lives at `components/open_capture.yaml` and is declared in the
manifest's `components:` list, same as the other exports.

> **Future consideration — modal-from-link triggers.** Some flows want
> a link or table row that opens capture in a modal without leaving the
> current page (e.g., clicking a "+ log activity" link in a list cell).
> The always-navigate behaviour above is wrong for that case. If this
> surfaces as a real need, an additional export (`capture_activity_link`
> or similar — a link-styled trigger that carries its own modal instance
> with it) would be the cleanest extension, without having to reinstate
> the cross-instance targeting problem on `open_capture`.

### `pageId: new` query params — deep-link capture

The new-activity page accepts URL query params so deep-links work.
Lowdefy URLs don't carry path params, so the contract is purely the
query string — the path itself is set by the consuming app's page
config:

```
?type=call&contact_id=<uuid>&company_id=<uuid>
?type=meeting&contact_ids[]=<uuid>&contact_ids[]=<uuid>
?type=note&title=Quick%20follow-up
```

Supported params: `type`, `title`, `contact_id`, `contact_ids[]`,
`company_id`, `company_ids[]`. Missing params leave form fields empty.
This is what `mode: page` serialises to (via `Link → pageId: new`,
`urlQuery: { … }`), and what external links (emails, chat messages,
Slack unfurls) target.

`description` is deliberately not URL-prefillable. The field renders
through the Tiptap block (rich-text HTML), and round-tripping HTML
through URL params is awkward enough — and the use cases thin enough —
to leave the field blank on landing. Channels that genuinely need to
seed body content (calendar/email/WhatsApp ingestion) bypass the URL
contract and call `create-activity` directly with `source: { … }` set.

### Built-in placements

Set up once by the module; consumers get these for free.

- **`tile_activities` header** — embeds `capture_activity` prefilled with
  the tile's `reference_field` and `reference_value`. So a contact
  detail page renders the tile, and its "Log activity" button is
  pre-linked to that contact.
- **Main nav entry** — the module's `menus.yaml` includes a "New
  activity" item triggering `open_capture` (or linking to
  `pageId: new` directly if the consumer prefers).

Home-page placement is left to the consuming app — it drops
`capture_activity` wherever makes sense, usually a prominent
dashboard tile or header action.

### Why one component and not separate per-context buttons?

A single `capture_activity` that takes prefill vars keeps the capture
flow consistent across every entry point. If the form changes (new
field, new validation, new event), it changes in one place. Consumers
don't choose between `button_new_activity_for_contact` vs
`button_new_activity_for_company` vs `button_new_activity_quick` —
they just pass prefill.

## API surface

### `create-activity`

Input:

```yaml
{
  type: string, # required, from activity_types enum
  title: string, # required
  description: string, # optional
  initial_stage: string, # optional — overrides the type's default_stage
  contact_ids: [UUID], # optional
  company_ids: [UUID], # optional
  attributes: object, # optional — consumer fields
  source: { channel, external_ref, raw }, # optional, defaults to { channel: 'manual' }
}
```

Attachments are uploaded separately via the `files` module, keyed by an
`activity_id` reference — not included in this payload.

Routine (high-level):

1. Resolve initial stage (`initial_stage` || type's `default_stage`).
2. Insert activity doc with `status: [{ stage, created: change_stamp }]`, `created` + `updated` stamps, and `removed: null` (matching `create-company.yaml`). List and detail requests exclude soft-deleted docs via `removed.timestamp: { $exists: false }`, the shape used by `get_all_companies.yaml` — not `{ removed: null }` literally.
3. Apply `request_stages.write` hook.
4. Emit `create-activity` event via `events.new-event` with:
   - `references: { contact_ids, company_ids, activity_ids: [new id] }`
   - `metadata: { activity_id: new id }` (matches the per-entity `metadata` pattern used by `create-company` / `create-contact` / `update-*`)
5. Return `{ activityId }`.

The same `metadata: { activity_id }` shape is included on every event
this module emits (`update-activity`, `complete-activity`,
`cancel-activity`, `reopen-activity`, `delete-activity`).

### `update-activity`

Updates editable fields (title, description, contact_ids, company_ids, attributes). Does **not** handle stage transitions (`change-activity-status`) or soft-delete (`delete-activity`).

Routine mirrors `update-company.yaml`:

1. `MongoDBUpdateOne` filtered on `_id` and `updated.timestamp` — optimistic concurrency. If the timestamp moved between load and write, the update misses and the API returns a stale-state error; client retries with the fresh stamp.
2. `$set` editable fields plus `updated: change_stamp`. Apply `request_stages.write` hook.
3. Emit `update-activity` with `references: { contact_ids, company_ids, activity_ids: [_id] }` carrying the **post-update** linked IDs only (matching `update-contact` / `update-company`) and `metadata: { activity_id }`.

> **Future consideration — delink visibility.** If a user removes contact X from an activity, contact X's events timeline sees nothing; as far as that timeline is concerned, the activity silently disappeared. Making delinks visible would require loading the pre-update doc, diffing old vs new link arrays, emitting `references` as the union (and potentially a dedicated `unlink-contact-from-activity` event type). Left out of v1 to match existing modules and avoid churn from future automated ingestion channels re-linking on every poll — revisit if user feedback shows the silent-unlink is confusing.

### `change-activity-status`

Input:

```yaml
{ activity_id: UUID, stage: open | done | cancelled }
```

Routine:

1. Load activity, read `status[0].stage` and `updated.timestamp`.
2. If `loaded.status[0].stage === stage`, no-op (return).
3. `MongoDBUpdateOne` with optimistic concurrency on both the loaded
   stage and timestamp — both must still match at write time:

   ```yaml
   filter:
     _id: { _payload: activity_id }
     status.0.stage: { _step: load.0.status.0.stage }
     updated.timestamp: { _step: load.0.updated.timestamp }
   update:
     $set:
       updated: { _ref: { module: events, component: change_stamp } }
     $push:
       status:
         $each: [{ stage, created: change_stamp }]
         $position: 0
   ```

   `$each` is required whenever `$position` is specified — without it
   MongoDB rejects the update. Bumping `updated.timestamp` keeps default
   sort (`updated.timestamp desc`) reflecting status flips per
   `decisions.md` §3. The filter on `status.0.stage` and
   `updated.timestamp` prevents two simultaneous "Mark done" clicks
   from each pushing a `done` entry — only the first lands; the
   second's filter misses.

4. Emit the matching event (`complete-activity` / `cancel-activity` / `reopen-activity`) with full references.
5. Return `{ previous_stage, new_stage }`.

Split from `update-activity` so the UI can expose one-click "Mark done" / "Cancel" / "Reopen" actions without a full form submit, and so the correct event type fires without the API having to diff input against current state.

### `delete-activity`

Input:

```yaml
{ activity_id: UUID }
```

Routine:

1. Update doc with `$set: { removed: change_stamp, updated: change_stamp }`,
   filtered on `_id` and `updated.timestamp` (optimistic concurrency, same
   as the other writes).
2. Emit `delete-activity` event with `references: { contact_ids,
   company_ids, activity_ids: [_id] }` and `metadata: { activity_id }`.
3. Return `{ success: true }`.

Dedicated single-purpose endpoint, mirroring the
`change-activity-status` precedent and the `files` module's
`delete-file`. Keeps `update-activity`'s editable-fields list clean
(no `removed` smuggled in) and makes the event-emission contract
obvious from the call site — the detail page's "Delete" button calls
`delete-activity`, end of story.

## Pages

Page IDs follow the entity-module convention (`all`, `view`, `edit`,
`new`). Lowdefy doesn't support nested URL paths or path params, so
entity IDs travel as `?_id=<uuid>` query params; cross-module
navigation goes via `pageId` rather than hard-coded URLs. The actual
URL slug for each page is set by the consuming app's page config.

### `pageId: all` — list

Standard list page: AgGridBalham table, filters panel (type, current stage, date range, linked contact, linked company, assignee-style), Excel download, pagination. Follows `.claude/guides/list-pages.md`. Row click links to `pageId: view` with `urlQuery: { _id }`.

**URL param hydration.** On `onInit`, `SetState` on `filter` from
`_url_query: contact_id` and `_url_query: company_id` (singular,
optional). When present, the list mounts with the corresponding
linked-entity filter pre-applied — feeds `tile_activities`'s "View
all" link and works as a deep-link contract for external triggers
(reminder emails, dashboards, Slack unfurls landing on
"activities for this contact"). Mirrors `pageId: new`'s URL-prefill
contract — same query-string-only convention, no path params.

### `pageId: view` — detail

Layout mirrors company-detail. Resolves the activity from `_url_query: _id`.

- **Main column** — `view_activity` (SmartDescriptions: type, title, description, current stage, linked contacts/companies as chips). Plus a status-history timeline (reading the status array). Plus the events-timeline scoped to this activity.
- **Sidebar tiles** — files, linked contacts, linked companies, events.
- **Header actions** — Edit, Mark done / Reopen / Cancel, Delete.

### `pageId: edit` — edit

`form_activity` wrapped in the standard edit-page layout. Resolves the activity from `_url_query: _id`. Submits to `update-activity`.

### `pageId: new` — create

`form_activity` wrapped in the standard new-page layout. Submits to
`create-activity`.

Accepts URL query params for prefill — see "Capture entry points →
`pageId: new` query params" for the full list. Used by
`capture_activity` in `mode: page` and by external deep-links (emails,
chat messages, shortcuts).

## Integration with companies / contacts

No schema changes to `companies` or `contacts` — linking is one-way on the activity doc.

Two touch points:

1. **Add `tile_activities` to `company-detail.yaml` and `contact-detail.yaml`** — belongs in the sidebar. Wired with the appropriate `reference_field`. Done in each entity module, not on the activities side, since that's where the sidebar slot lives.
2. **No changes to `events`**. The events module is consumed as-is for event emission and change-stamp generation.

If an app wants activities but doesn't want the tile on companies by default, it can omit the tile from its `components.sidebar_slots` override.

## Future channels (reserved, not implemented in v1)

The `source` field on the activity doc is the seam for future auto-ingestion. Planned shape for each channel:

| Channel         | Trigger                                                                | External source     | `raw` contents                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calendar`      | Calendar event created/updated (Google/Outlook via webhook or polling) | iCal UID            | Full calendar event JSON                                |
| `email-forward` | Email forwarded/cc'd to an app-specific address                        | Message-ID          | Parsed email (from, to, cc, subject, body, attachments) |
| `whatsapp`      | Message/voicenote to a bot number                                      | WhatsApp message ID | Message payload + transcription                         |
| `voicenote`     | Uploaded audio file to a capture endpoint                              | S3 key              | Transcription + audio reference                         |

Ingestion will land as separate Lambda functions (via `splice-lambda`) that call a new internal `ingest-activity` API. That API is not built in v1 but will be implemented by reusing `create-activity` with a non-manual `source` and contact/company resolution done in the Lambda (match sender email → contact → derive company linking).

Design decisions this phase locks in:

- `source.external_ref` is covered by a partial index (see "Indexes" above) to enable idempotent ingestion — a replay of the same calendar event updates the existing activity rather than inserting a duplicate.
- `source.channel` is a free string rather than a strict enum, so apps can add proprietary channels without changing the module.
- The `type` enum is independent of the `source` channel — a `calendar`-sourced activity can be of type `meeting` (expected) or `call` (a scheduled phone call).

## Files changed / added

**New module:**

- `modules/activities/` — full module tree as above.

**Touched modules:**

- `modules/companies/pages/company-detail.yaml` — add `tile_activities` to sidebar slots.
- `modules/contacts/pages/contact-detail.yaml` — add `tile_activities` to sidebar slots.
- `modules/companies/components/tile_events.yaml` — rename card `title` from `Activity` to `History`. The existing system-events tile is currently labelled "Activity" in the UI, which collides with the new `tile_activities`. Activities (user-created) keep the "Activity" label; the system-audit log becomes "History".
- `modules/contacts/components/tile_events.yaml` — same `title: Activity` → `title: History` rename.
- `modules/shared/enums/event_types.yaml` — include `_ref: ../activities/enums/event_types.yaml` in the assign chain, so app-level `event_types` aggregations pick up activity events.

**Demo app:**

- `apps/demo/modules.yaml` — register the `activities` module entry, wire `layout`/`events`/`contacts`/`companies`/`files` dependencies.
- `apps/demo/menus.yaml` — add nav link to activities list (via the module's `menus` export).
- `apps/demo/pages/` — home page embeds a prominent `capture_activity` (no prefill) as a working reference for consumers.

**No changes to:** `events`, `notifications`, `layout`, `user-admin`, `user-account`, `release-notes`, `data-upload`.

## Non-goals (v1)

- **Scheduled / due dates** — no `scheduled_at` field in v1. Adding it later is cheap (append a field, extend the form, extend indexes) and we avoid guessing the right shape now. See "Deferred" below.
- **Consecutive human IDs** (`A-0001`) — UUIDs only.
- **Priority field on tasks** — not a first-class field. Consumers needing it can add it via `attributes`; it can be promoted later if demand is proven.
- **File attachments inlined on the activity doc** — handled by the `files` module's own collection, keyed by `activity_id`.
- **Auto-ingestion from calendar / email / WhatsApp / voicenotes** — schema reserves space; implementation is a later phase.
- **Recurrence** — no "repeats weekly" modelling. A recurring meeting is N separate activities until we need otherwise.
- **Reminders / notifications for upcoming activities** — the `notifications` module can be wired in by a consumer, but the activities module doesn't push reminders itself in v1.
- **Assignment to multiple users** — activities have a creator (via `created.user`). A dedicated `assigned_to` field is not in v1; can be added as an attribute by consumers, and promoted to a first-class field later.
- **Activity templates / canned responses** — out of scope.
- **Deals linking** — `deal_ids` is reserved in the design but not added to the schema/pipeline/UI until the `deals` module exists.

## Deferred

### Scheduled / due dates

`scheduled_at` is deferred until a real need emerges — most likely when
calendar-channel ingestion lands, since that's where planned times become
unavoidable. When we add it, the shape choice is between:

**A. Top-level `scheduled_at: ISODate` field.** Simple to query, sort, and
display. Clear separation — status tracks lifecycle, schedule tracks planned
time. Reschedules overwrite the field; reschedule history is captured by
`update-activity` events.

**B. `scheduled` stage inside the status array**, with the timestamp on the
entry: `{ stage: 'scheduled', scheduled_for: ISODate, created: change_stamp }`.
Single history structure; reschedules produce new entries. But mixes
"current state" and "planned time" semantics — `current_stage` then
includes `scheduled`, which downstream queries ("show me open work") have to
special-case.

**Lean when we revisit:** A. B unifies two things that aren't really the
same — a planned time and a lifecycle stage — and forces every filter and
sort to branch on `scheduled` as a pseudo-state.

Migration path is clean either way: the status-array pattern already
records history, and adding a scalar field or a new stage type doesn't
invalidate existing docs.
