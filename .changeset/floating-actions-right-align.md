**Breaking:** the `layout` `floating-actions` component now lays its buttons out with `direction: row` + `justify: flex-end` + `wrap: nowrap` instead of `direction: row-reverse`. Buttons are now listed in natural left-to-right order (the last one renders rightmost), and the bar never wraps onto a second line.

Migration: reverse the order of buttons in each `floating-actions` `actions:` array — what used to be listed first (and rendered rightmost under `row-reverse`) must now be listed last. Every action button must set `layout: { flex: 0 1 auto }` so it is content-sized rather than a full-width grid column; a button without it stretches full width and stacks onto its own line. Any `spacer` Box or `width` var previously used to coax right-alignment is no longer needed and should be removed.

All in-repo callers (contacts, activities, companies, user-account, user-admin) have been updated to the new order. The workflows action-page templates (edit/view/review/error) and the shared `check-action-surface` signal bar (used by the in-context action modal and the `workflow-action-*` pages) now set `flex: 0 1 auto` on every signal button and order them so the primary action lands rightmost, fixing buttons that previously stacked onto multiple lines and left-aligned. The signal bar's `justify` was also corrected from the invalid `flex-end` token to `end` (Lowdefy's justify map only accepts `end`; `flex-end` silently fell back to left alignment).
