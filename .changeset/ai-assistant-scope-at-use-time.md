'@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-ai-assistant': patch
---

The `ai-assistant` module now resolves its `scope` var each time it uses it — minting a thread, listing threads, saving one — rather than once when the page initialises. A scope operator whose value arrives late, such as one reading state populated by an async request, previously froze as null and partitioned every thread under the same empty scope.

The module still cannot see a scope that changes while the app is running, because nothing in it can observe an app global moving. The docs now carry the recipe for that case: compare `ai_scope` against your own source of truth in `onMount`, which runs on every visit, and clear the open thread when they differ.
