description: Use when writing or editing Lowdefy YAML config — pages, blocks, operators, actions, connections, or requests. Looks up exact type names, schemas, and examples from the running dev server instead of guessing.

# Writing Lowdefy config

The dev server serves docs for everything installed in this project at
`http://localhost:3000/lowdefy-docs` (also as MCP tools via the `lowdefy-docs` server).

The Lowdefy app config (lowdefy.yaml, pages, requests) lives in `apps/demo/`.

Never guess type names or properties. Before writing config:

1. Call `lowdefy_list_types` (or `GET /lowdefy-docs/blocks`, `/lowdefy-docs/operators`,
   `/lowdefy-docs/actions`, `/lowdefy-docs/connections`, `/lowdefy-docs/requests`) to find the exact
   type name — this includes this project's local plugins.
2. Call `lowdefy_get_schema` (or `GET /lowdefy-docs/schema/{kind}/{type}`) for the
   exact properties and events of that type.
3. Call `lowdefy_get_examples` (or `GET /lowdefy-docs/examples/{type}`) to see real
   usage YAML for blocks.
4. For concepts (state, operators, events, requests), call `lowdefy_get_doc`
   or `lowdefy_search_docs`.

## Visual feedback

Developers can press `Cmd/Ctrl+/` in the running app to point at, draw on, and comment on
what's on screen; the annotation helper copies an agent-readable feedback block to their
clipboard, which they paste to you. Pasted blocks start with "Feedback:" and include the
config file and line each annotation refers to — treat them as precise UI feedback and use
`lowdefy_inspect_state` for the page's live state.
