# @lowdefy/modules-mongodb-release-notes

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#316](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/316) [`e857039`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/e8570395614810b639ca73540b8aa6764fe3e854) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **Breaking: v2 makes the files module safe for an app with many organizations.** Until now anyone signed in who held a file's key could get a download link for it, whatever organization or record it belonged to, and could save a record over another file's key. Every file operation now goes through a files module endpoint that loads the record and runs an access check the app can supply, and every download link is signed from a stored record. Every module and the plugin move to 2.0.0 together, on Lowdefy 7 as before; no framework upgrade is needed. Files already uploaded stay where they are and keep working, so there is no data migration.

  To upgrade an app:

  1. **Move off the removed files requests.** The `get-entity-files`, `upload-policy` and `download-policy` page requests and the `download-policy` component export are gone. The `file-manager`, `file-card` and `file-list` components need no page requests now. An app that lists, uploads, saves, downloads or deletes files itself calls the endpoints `list-files`, `upload-policy`, `save-file`, `download-file` and `delete-file` (`files/<endpoint>` in app config). `save-file` takes `{ entity_type, entity_id, key, thumbnail?, file_title?, file_category?, metadata? }` with a key `upload-policy` minted, and `delete-file` and `download-file` take `{ file_id }`. See `docs/files/reference/endpoints.md`.
  2. **Decide who may work with a record's files.** Without config, every signed-in member of the organization may. To narrow it, write an app endpoint that answers `{ allowed: true }` or `{ allowed: false, message }` for `{ operation, entity_type, entity_id, file_id }` and name it in the files module's `access_check: { endpoint_id }` var. It may be asked about a record that is not saved yet (the activities module mints an activity's id before saving it).
  3. **Check the upload limits.** Uploads are capped at `max_file_size`, 25 MB by default; raise it if the app takes larger files. Set `allowed_content_types` to limit the types `upload-policy` accepts.
  4. **Rename the download property on blocks.** FileManager, EventsTimeline, DataDescriptions and SmartDescriptions take `downloadEndpointId` (and an optional `downloadPayload`) in place of `s3GetPolicyRequestId`; with only the old property set they show no download. Point it at the files module's `download-file` for files module records. An app that signs its own files writes an endpoint that takes `{ file_id, ...downloadPayload }`, loads the record the file belongs to, and returns `{ url }`, failing with a message (`:reject:`) to refuse.
  5. **Events timeline:** the `events-timeline` component's `s3GetPolicyRequestId` var is now `download_endpoint_id`, null by default. Set it to `files/download-file` to show downloads for files on `event.files`. A file there that is not a file record no longer downloads.
  6. **Workflows:** the `file_download` field's `s3GetPolicyRequestId` var is replaced by `download_endpoint_id` and `download_payload`, which default to the workflows module's `download-form-file` with the page's `{ workflow_id }`, so form files keep downloading with no app config. Drop `s3GetPolicyRequestId`; to show files module records in the field, set `download_endpoint_id: files/download-file`. The overview pages no longer pull in the files module's `download-policy`.
  7. **Workflow form uploads must carry the organization.** The app's `upload_files` request (the `file_upload` field's `s3PostPolicyRequestId`) must mint keys under `{organization_id}/workflows/`, for example `{organization_id}/workflows/{workflow type}/{uuid}/{name}`; see the `file_upload` field in `docs/workflows/reference/form-components.md`. Submitting a form refuses a new file under any other key, and `download-form-file` signs only those keys and keys from before the upgrade, so a form file with another organization's key, or a files module or support key, no longer downloads.
  8. **Support uploads** land under `{organization_id}/support/{user id}/`, or `support/{user id}/` for a user with no organization. An app that signs or checks support keys by the `support/{user id}/` prefix must accept the organization prefix too.
  9. **Guard the app's own signing requests.** A page request that signs any key the browser sends gives anyone signed in every object in the bucket, including other organizations' files. An app that signs its own download links for other prefixes in the same bucket (chat attachments, for example) should sign only keys under the caller's own prefix and return a null key for any other, as `apps/demo/modules/ai-assistant/attachment_requests.yaml` does.

  New uploads land under `{organization_id}/files/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/`; older objects keep their keys and still download, because signing goes by the record rather than the key. The other entries in this release give each module's changes in full.

### Minor Changes

- [#317](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/317) [`ec3b2ff`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/ec3b2ffd7ecf198a4aaad4644b876c0eff0febcb) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **release-notes:** an app can show a New mark while a release note is unread.

  - New exported component `get_unread_release_notes_count`: a request of the same name that counts the signed-in person's unread notes as `[{ total }]`. Add it to a page's `requests` or the layout's `global_requests`, fire it with a `Request` action, and read `_request: get_unread_release_notes_count.0.total` to show a "New" mark while it is above zero.
  - New var `about`: one sentence on what the page is for, handed to the layout page component as `about`. A layout that shows a page's `about` on its last crumb uses it; other layouts ignore it.

  What's new itself looks as before.

### Minor Changes

- [#302](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/302) [`76ec282`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/76ec28225da70b5b43284ce01d5e246730fdb8a1) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **Breaking: the release-notes module no longer renders `CHANGELOG.md`.** It now takes release notes the team announces from Pelican, which arrive on the support module's signed webhook. The support webhook hands `release.*` events to the module, and the module answers Pelican's `release.audience` with live counts of who an announcement would reach.

  - **release-notes:** the `content` var is removed. New vars: `audiences` (the groups Pelican can announce to, each a filter over the person's `user-members` row), `email_template` and `region` (required). The module now depends on `notifications`, `files` and `events`, declares three collections (`release-notes`, `release-notes-recipients`, `release-notes-preferences`) and read-only views of the auth `user-members`, `users` and `user-organizations`, and exports an internal `receive` endpoint.
  - **support:** new var `release_notes_endpoint`, the release-notes receiver's full endpoint id (such as `release-notes/receive`). With it null, the webhook answers `release.*` events 404. `app_version` is now described as the app's bare X.Y.Z version, which Pelican compares with the release it announces.

  Migration:

  - Remove `content` from the release-notes entry and set `region` (the public files bucket's region) and any `audiences`.
  - Add an `events` module entry if the app has none.
  - Set the support module's `release_notes_endpoint` to `{release-notes entry id}/receive`, and `app_version` from the build.
  - Create the two indexes on `release-notes-recipients` listed in the module's docs.

- [#302](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/302) [`308e228`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/308e2281e862c001b6ec2748376b2e37eed0bc0b) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **release-notes:** an announced release note now reaches the app's members. `release.announced` stores the note and a recipient row per person the audience reaches, and answers `{ notified, emailed, opted_out }`. A detached `deliver` chain copies the note's images and videos into the public files bucket and sends each person one `release-note` notification per version, in the bell and by email. The new exported `sweep` endpoint restarts a chain that stalled.

  Migration:

  - Set `CRON_SECRET` in the app's environment, which detached endpoint calls need.
  - Add an app endpoint that calls `release-notes/sweep` every 10 minutes with a `schedules:` cron, as the module docs show.

- [#302](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/302) [`aeb1397`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/aeb1397c251322885efbefcf93d7ee424ecd7720) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **release-notes:** the release note email now shows the note's body, with its headings, lists, links and images, and a footer link to turn release emails off on What's new. A video in the note becomes a link to the note on What's new. Pelican's new `release.test` event sends that email to one address, so the team can check it before announcing; it writes nothing and rings no bell.

  **notifications:** a new exported `send-email` endpoint renders one notification and emails it to one address without storing it, for test sends.

  Migration:

  - An app that restyles the email with `email_template` adds the body to its copy of the template, as the module docs show. Without it, its email carries no body.

- [#302](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/302) [`9602441`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/960244158955c99253f0867f2a23e82346da0059) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - **release-notes:** What's new lists the notes announced to the signed-in person, newest first, beside the one picked (`urlQuery.note`, else the newest). Images and videos embedded in a note load from the public files bucket; one not copied yet shows a placeholder. A New mark clears once the person has opened the note, in every organisation. A switch at the foot, **Email me about new releases**, saves the person's choice; `urlQuery.section=email` scrolls to it. The menu link now reads "What's new".

  The module now reads the `FILES_S3_BUCKET_PUB` secret.

  Migration: set `FILES_S3_BUCKET_PUB` (the files module's public bucket) for the app.

### Major Changes

- [#303](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/303) [`f7659a7`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/f7659a77af93cd37291a62869accf0cfcd123f7d) Thanks [@SamTolmay](https://github.com/SamTolmay)! - **Breaking: the modules need Lowdefy 7.** This release moves every module and the plugins package to Lowdefy 7 and its auth engine, page paths, tenant wall, websockets and Lucide icons. Apps on Lowdefy 5 or 6 stay on the previous release.

  To upgrade, move the app to Lowdefy 7 (`lowdefy upgrade` applies the framework codemods), then work through the breaking entries in this release, chiefly:

  - **Icon names** are Lowdefy 7 semantic and Lucide names; icon names an app passes into module vars need the same rewrite.
  - **`app_name` is gone.** Declare `slug:` on the root of `lowdefy.yaml` and drop the var from every module entry.
  - **`user-account` and `user-admin` run on the Better Auth engine**, with contacts linked to their auth user and organization authority separate from app roles.
  - **Search:** `request_stages.filter_match` takes plain `$match` clauses, the new `atlas_search` var picks Atlas `$search` or a regex fallback, and the Atlas Search index contract changes.
  - **Events:** `contact_page_url` is replaced by `contact_page_id`.
  - **ai-reporting:** the app lists the module's `report-policy` in `policies.dynamicBlocks`, and the report endpoints return `report_id` without `url`.
  - **`profile.picture`** is derived by every write, and `create-contact` mints the contact `_id` itself.

### Minor Changes

- [#242](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/242) [`9e083dc`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/9e083dc8a2696abeee3c91004c75fdc2606196d8) Thanks [@SamTolmay](https://github.com/SamTolmay)! - **Breaking: icon names are Lowdefy 7 semantic and Lucide names.** Lowdefy 7 replaces react-icons with Lucide and fails the build on a react-icons name, so every `AiOutline*`, `AiFill*` and `Lu*` name in the modules and the plugin blocks is rewritten with the `@lowdefy/codemods` `v7-0-0/react-icons-to-lucide.json` table: a semantic name (`edit`, `delete`, `mail`) where one fits, otherwise the Lucide name (`Waypoints`, `FileSpreadsheet`).

  The modules now need a Lowdefy version with Lucide icons. Glyphs the table marks for review: filled status icons (`check-circle`, `close-circle`, `CircleAlert`) are outline, the FileManager's PDF and Word icons are both `FileText` and its Excel icon is `FileSpreadsheet`, and the Cluster icon is `Waypoints`.

  Apps that pass icon names into module vars (menu entries, enum `icon` fields, `event_types`) need the same rewrite; `lowdefy upgrade` applies it.

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/35) [`930d7c1`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/930d7c18d1104fcc03e769907c4cae37ece3b771) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - Fix `@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins` peer-version references in module manifests so they track the plugin's actual published version. The previous releases shipped with a hardcoded `^0.1.0` constraint inside every `module.lowdefy.yaml`, which Lowdefy's strict 0.x semver matching rejected once the plugin moved to `0.2.0` — apps that installed `@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins@0.2.0` (the only version compatible with v0.2.0 modules) failed to build with `Module "events" requires plugin "@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins" version "^0.1.0" but the app has version "0.2.0" installed`.

  Modules and the plugin live in the same Changesets `fixed` group, so they're always lockstep on release. `scripts/sync-module-versions.mjs` (run as part of `release:version`) now also rewrites the plugin reference in every module manifest to `^${pluginVersion}`, keeping the manifests' constraint aligned with the plugin's published version on every bump.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/28) [`2c4aa70`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/2c4aa70f54840a33d5f21ea45539328a860d3525) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Rename module pages from entity-prefixed IDs to semantic verbs to remove the redundant URL prefix (e.g. `/companies/companies` → `/companies/all`). Module pages now use `all`, `view`, `edit`, `new` consistently. Cross-module references via `_module.pageId:` and hardcoded scoped page IDs (`{entry-id}/{page-id}`) must be updated to the new IDs.

  Page ID changes per module:

  - `companies`: `companies` → `all`, `company-detail` → `view`, `company-edit` → `edit`, `company-new` → `new`
  - `contacts`: `contacts` → `all`, `contact-detail` → `view`, `contact-edit` → `edit`, `contact-new` → `new`
  - `user-admin`: `users` → `all`, `users-view` → `view`, `users-edit` → `edit`, `users-invite` → `new`, `check-invite-email` → `check`
  - `user-account`: `profile` → `view`, `edit-profile` → `edit`, `create-profile` → `new` (`login`/`logout`/`verify-email-request` unchanged)
  - `release-notes`: `release-notes` → `view`
  - `notifications`: `inbox` → `all` (`link`/`invalid` unchanged)

  Plugin defaults updated to match: `SmartDescriptions` now defaults `contactDetailPageId` to `contacts/view` and `companyDetailPageId` to `companies/view`; `EventsTimeline` schema example updated.

  Also includes two fixes to the contacts new page: removed a duplicate avatar render (the avatar block was included both directly and via `form_profile`), and fixed the post-create redirect that was navigating with a null `_id` because CallAPI return values are accessed at `_actions: <id>.response.response.<field>`, not `.response.<field>`. Same redirect fix applied to the companies new page.

### Patch Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/31) [`fcd328b`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/fcd328b031df108450147a91b87d85a508c1f008) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Small UX fixes across modules and the EventsTimeline block:

  - `release-notes`: Empty-state fallback now triggers when `content` is null OR an empty/whitespace-only string. The previous `_if_none` only caught null, so consumers with an empty `CHANGELOG.md` saw a blank Card instead of the "No release notes available yet" message.
  - `companies` / `contacts` / `user-admin` table components: Added a conditional `overlayNoRowsTemplate` that renders "Loading…" while the `get_all_*` request is in flight and "No rows" once the request completes empty. Previously AG Grid's default "No Rows To Show" appeared during the initial load, indistinguishable from a genuinely empty result.
  - `EventsTimeline` (plugin): Avatar hover swapped from `<Popover>` to `<Tooltip>` so it matches the timestamp's TimeAgo style — same name-on-hover, lighter dark-tooltip styling.
