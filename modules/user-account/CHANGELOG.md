### Patch Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/82) [`163529c`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/163529cd6063914ff715b37934feea595967ee86) Thanks [@SamTolmay](https://github.com/SamTolmay)! - **Breaking:** the `layout` `floating-actions` component now lays its buttons out with `direction: row` + `justify: flex-end` + `wrap: nowrap` instead of `direction: row-reverse`. Buttons are now listed in natural left-to-right order (the last one renders rightmost), and the bar never wraps onto a second line.

  Migration: reverse the order of buttons in each `floating-actions` `actions:` array — what used to be listed first (and rendered rightmost under `row-reverse`) must now be listed last. Every action button must set `layout: { flex: 0 1 auto }` so it is content-sized rather than a full-width grid column; a button without it stretches full width and stacks onto its own line. Any `spacer` Box or `width` var previously used to coax right-alignment is no longer needed and should be removed.

  All in-repo callers (contacts, activities, companies, user-account, user-admin) have been updated to the new order. The workflows action-page templates (edit/view/review/error) and the shared `check-action-surface` signal bar (used by the in-context action modal and the `workflow-action-*` pages) now set `flex: 0 1 auto` on every signal button and order them so the primary action lands rightmost, fixing buttons that previously stacked onto multiple lines and left-aligned. The signal bar's `justify` was also corrected from the invalid `flex-end` token to `end` (Lowdefy's justify map only accepts `end`; `flex-end` silently fell back to left alignment).

The request scoped the dropdown to `apps.{app_name}.is_user` using `_module.var: app_name`, but these components are only ever consumed through a cross-module `_ref` and `_module.var` resolved to `null` in that scope — so the query matched `apps.null.is_user` and returned nothing. It now reads the app slug via `_app: slug`, which resolves from the app root independently of module-entry-var resolution. Consuming apps must declare `slug:` on their `lowdefy.yaml` (kebab-case).

- [`ad80095`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/ad800955415ff9e5858a0ce3d8fc6ddd5b241046) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - Bump `@lowdefy/community-plugin-mongodb` peer requirement from `^2` to `^3` across all modules that depend on it (`activities`, `companies`, `contacts`, `notifications`, `user-account`, `user-admin`). Consumer apps must update their plugin install to the v3 line; module config and exports are otherwise unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- [#45](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/45) [`d64b5d2`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/d64b5d25183f77c0f9eae925765cfa858c742eaa) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Change `event_display` defaulting and override semantics across all event-emitting modules. The default (no override) now renders titles under the consumer's `app_name` instead of a literal `default` key, and an override fully replaces the defaults instead of merging with them.

  **Behavior changes (potentially breaking for consumers):**

  - **Override fully replaces, no merge.** Whatever you write under `event_display` is exactly what's stored on the event document. Consumers that previously relied on partial overrides being merged with the module's defaults must now list every app and event type they want rendered.
  - **Defaults file shape changed.** `modules/{name}/defaults/event_display.yaml` is now a flat `{ event-type: template }` map. The previous top-level `default:` wrapper is gone — the build wraps the flat map under the consumer's `app_name` var. Consumers that `_ref` the defaults file directly will see the new shape.
  - **`companies` now requires `app_name`.** Every event-emitting module declares its app context the same way contacts/user-admin/user-account already did. Companies consumers must add `app_name` to their module vars (typically wired from `app_config.yaml`).

  **Migration:**

  - If you didn't override `event_display`, no action needed beyond setting `app_name` on companies.
  - If you overrode `event_display`, list every app and event type you want stored — defaults no longer fill the gaps. The override shape stays `{ [app_name]: { [event-type]: template } }`.

  See [`docs/shared/event-display.md`](../../docs/shared/event-display.md) for the updated reference.

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/35) [`930d7c1`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/930d7c18d1104fcc03e769907c4cae37ece3b771) Thanks [@Gervwyk](https://github.com/Gervwyk)! - Fix `@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins` peer-version references in module manifests so they track the plugin's actual published version. The previous releases shipped with a hardcoded `^0.1.0` constraint inside every `module.lowdefy.yaml`, which Lowdefy's strict 0.x semver matching rejected once the plugin moved to `0.2.0` — apps that installed `@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins@0.2.0` (the only version compatible with v0.2.0 modules) failed to build with `Module "events" requires plugin "@lowdefy/modules-mongodb-plugins" version "^0.1.0" but the app has version "0.2.0" installed`.

  Modules and the plugin live in the same Changesets `fixed` group, so they're always lockstep on release. `scripts/sync-module-versions.mjs` (run as part of `release:version`) now also rewrites the plugin reference in every module manifest to `^${pluginVersion}`, keeping the manifests' constraint aligned with the plugin's published version on every bump.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/28) [`2c4aa70`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/2c4aa70f54840a33d5f21ea45539328a860d3525) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Rename module pages from entity-prefixed IDs to semantic verbs to remove the redundant URL prefix (e.g. `/companies/companies` → `/companies/all`). Module pages now use `all`, `view`, `edit`, `new` consistently. Cross-module references via `_module.pageId:` and hardcoded scoped page IDs (`{entry-id}/{page-id}`) must be updated to the new IDs.

  Page ID changes per module:

  - `companies`: `companies` → `all`, `company-detail` → `view`, `company-edit` → `edit`, `company-new` → `new`
  - `contacts`: `contacts` → `all`, `contact-detail` → `view`, `contact-edit` → `edit`, `contact-new` → `new`
  - `user-admin`: `users` → `all`, `users-view` → `view`, `users-edit` → `edit`, `users-invite` → `new`, `check-invite-email` → `check`
  - `user-account`: `profile` → `view`, `edit-profile` → `edit`, `create-profile` → `new` (`login`/`logout`/`verify-email-request` unchanged)
  - `release-notes`: `release-notes` → `view`
  - `notifications`: `inbox` → `all` (`link`/`invalid` unchanged)

  Plugin defaults updated to match: `SmartDescriptions` now defaults `contactDetailPageId` to `contacts/view` and `companyDetailPageId` to `companies/view`; `EventsTimeline` schema example updated.

  Also includes two fixes to the contacts new page: removed a duplicate avatar render (the avatar block was included both directly and via `form_profile`), and fixed the post-create redirect that was navigating with a null `_id` because CallAPI return values are accessed at `_actions: <id>.response.response.<field>`, not `.response.<field>`. Same redirect fix applied to the companies new page.

### Patch Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/31) [`a167d18`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/a167d18871d59b544cfaa546f65d31aa3250b0e4) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Fix Activity tile missing user-related events on contact-detail. user-account and user-admin events tagged the same shared `user-contacts` record under `references.user_ids`, while the Activity tile filters on `contact_ids` — so events like `update-profile`, `invite-user`, `update-user`, `resend-invite`, and `create-profile` never surfaced on the contact's timeline. Since contacts and users live in one collection with one `_id` space, a user IS a contact. Renamed the reference field on those 5 events from `user_ids` to `contact_ids` so the existing single-field timeline match returns them. Event semantics (user vs. plain contact) stay encoded in the event `type`. Migration for existing event docs is the consuming app's responsibility — `db.log-events.updateMany({ user_ids: { $exists: true } }, [{ $set: { contact_ids: '$user_ids' } }, { $unset: 'user_ids' }])`.

- [#27](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/pull/27) [`24b8dd1`](https://github.com/lowdefy/modules-mongodb/commit/24b8dd1e389ef6aaeab8d4fa56f7f393187db32c) Thanks [@Yianni99](https://github.com/Yianni99)! - Fix silent empty `display` payload on every event-emitting endpoint. The `_build.array.map` callback that builds per-app event display titles returned `{key, value}` objects, which `_build.object.fromEntries` (native `Object.fromEntries`) silently rejected as `{}` — so events landed in MongoDB without `title` or `description`. Switched callback bodies to a 2-element `[key, value]` array tuple to match the spec, and quoted `"0.0"` so YAML parses it as a path string instead of the float `0`. Affects 9 endpoints: `contacts/api/{create,update}-contact`, `companies/api/{create,update}-company`, `user-admin/api/{invite,update}-user`, `user-admin/api/resend-invite`, `user-account/api/{create,update}-profile`. Also fixed two latent typos (`_result` → `_step`) in `user-account/api/{create,update}-profile.yaml` that were hidden by the silent failure.
